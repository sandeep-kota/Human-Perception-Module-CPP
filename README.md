## Project Overview

This project is the implementation of a human obstace detector for an autonomous vehicle software stack. 

## Application

Pedestrian detection should be given the maximum priority in an autonomous vehicle software stack as it deals with the lives of the people. Hence, it is critical for the autonomus vehicle to predict the humans with maximum accuracy. Developing a dedicated human detector module helps in achieving improved prediction accuracies for this specific tasks without effect on the other perception modules.

## Development using Agile Iterative Process (AIP) and Test-Driven Development

An agile iterative process (AIP) is followed for the development of this project where the product backlog is developed first. Based on the priority of the tasks, the sprint cycles and tasks are decided. A daily meeting at the begging of the sprint cycle is conducted to decide on the daily tasks for each developer. The project backlog consists of the estimated time of completion which is alloted for each task. The actual time of completion is altered based on the progress of the project and the remaining tasks.

After planning the product backlog, UML flow diagram and UML class diagram for the software are created. A set of unit tests are used to verify the performance on a wide range of exple scenarios. Stub implementations are written with the functions to ensure that the code coverage of the softwrae is maintained.
